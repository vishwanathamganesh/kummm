            <p>SQL tutorial provides basic and advanced concepts of SQL. Our SQL tutorial is designed for both beginners and professionals.</p>
            <p>SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to perform operations on the records stored in the database, such as updating records, inserting records, deleting records, creating and modifying database tables, views, etc.</p>
            <p>Suppose you want to perform the queries of SQL language on the stored data in the database. You are required to install any database management system in your systems, for example, Oracle, MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, DB2, etc.</p>
            <p>SQL is a short-form of the structured query language, and it is pronounced as S-Q-L or sometimes as See-Quell.</p>
            <p>This database language is mainly designed for maintaining the data in relational database management systems. It is a special tool used by data professionals for handling structured data (data which is stored in the form of tables). It is also designed for stream processing in RDSMS.</p>
            <p>You can easily create and manipulate the database, access and modify the table rows and columns, etc. This query language became the standard of ANSI in the year of 1986 and ISO in the year of 1987.</p>
            <p>If you want to get a job in the field of data science, then it is the most important query language to learn. Big enterprises like Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn, use SQL for storing the data in the back-end.</p>
            <p>The basic use of SQL for data professionals and SQL users is to insert, update, and delete the data from the relational database.</p>
            <p>SQL allows the data professionals and users to retrieve the data from the relational database management systems.</p>
            <p>It also allows SQL users to set the permissions or constraints on table columns, views, and stored procedures.</p>
            <p>The IBM researchers Raymond Boyce and Donald Chamberlin originally developed the SEQUEL (Structured English Query Language) after learning from the paper given by E.F. Codd. They both developed the SQL at the San Jose Research laboratory of IBM Corporation in 1970.</p>
            <p>At the end of the 1970s, relational software Inc. developed their own first SQL using the concepts of E.F. Codd, Raymond Boyce, and Donald Chamberlin. This SQL was totally based on RDBMS. Relational Software Inc., which is now known as Oracle Corporation, introduced the Oracle V2 in June 1979, which is the first implementation of SQL language. This Oracle V2 version operates on VAX computers.</p>
            <p>When we are executing the command of SQL on any Relational database management system, then the system automatically finds the best routine to carry out our request, and the SQL engine determines how to interpret that particular command.</p>
            <p>This command helps in creating the new database, new table, table view, and other objects of the database.</p>
            <p>This command helps in updating or changing the stored data in the database.</p>
            <p>This command helps in removing or erasing the saved records from the database tables. It erases single or multiple tuples from the tables of the database.</p>
            <p>This command helps in accessing the single or multiple rows from one or multiple tables of the database. We can also use this command with the WHERE clause.</p>
            <p>SQL provides various advantages which make it more popular in the field of data science. It is a perfect query language which allows data professionals and users to communicate with the database. Following are the best advantages or benefits of Structured Query Language:</p>
            <p>SQL does not require a large number of coding lines for managing the database systems. We can easily access and maintain the database by using simple SQL syntactical rules. These simple rules make the SQL user-friendly.</p>
            <p>A large amount of data is accessed quickly and efficiently from the database by using SQL queries. Insertion, deletion, and updation operations on data are also performed in less time</p>
            <p>SQL follows the long-established standards of ISO and ANSI, which offer a uniform platform across the globe to all its users.</p>
