            <p>AngularJS tutorial provides basic and advanced concepts of AngularJS. Our AngularJS tutorial is designed for beginners and professionals.Angular JS is an open source JavaScript framework by Google to build web applications. It can be freely used, changed and shared by anyone.</p>
            <p>Our AngularJS tutorial includes all topics of AngularJS such as mvc, expressions, directives, controllers, modules, scopes, filters, dom, forms, ajax, validation, services, animation, dependency injection, views, w3.css etc. There are also given AngularJS interview questions to help you better understand the AngularJS.</p>
            <p>Angular JS is an open source JavaScript framework that is used to build web applications. It can be freely used, changed and shared by anyone.Angular Js is developed by Google.It is an excellent framework for building single phase applications and line of business applications.</p>
            <p>Advantage of AngularJS There are a lot of JavaScript frameworks for building web applications. So, it is a genuine question, why to use Angular JS.</p>
            <p>Dependency Injection: Dependency Injection specifies a design pattern in which components are given their dependencies instead of hard coding them within the component.Two way data binding: AngularJS creates a two way data-binding between the select element and the orderProp model. orderProp is then used as the input for the orderBy filter.Testing: Angular JS is designed in a way that we can test right from the start. So, it is very easy to test any of its components through unit testing and end-to-end testing.Model View Controller: In Angular JS, it is very easy to develop application in a clean MVC way. You just have to split your application code into MVC components i.e. Model, View and the Controller.Directives, filters, modules, routes etc.</p>
            <p>AngularJS MVC Architecture MVC stands for Model View Controller. It is a software design pattern for developing web applications. It is very popular because it isolates the application logic from the user interface layer and supports separation of concerns.</p>
            <p>The MVC pattern is made up of the following three parts:Model: It is responsible for managing application data. It responds to the requests from view and to the instructions from controller to update itself.
            View: It is responsible for displaying all data or only a portion of data to the users. It also specifies the data in a particular format triggered by the controller's decision to present the data. They are script-based template systems such as JSP, ASP, PHP and very easy to integrate with AJAX technology.
            Controller: It is responsible to control the relation between models and views. It responds to user input and performs interactions on the data model objects. The controller receives input, validates it, and then performs business operations that modify the state of the data model.</p>
            <p>Data binding is a very useful and powerful feature used in software development technologies. It acts as a bridge between the view and business logic of the application.AngularJS follows Two-Way data binding model.</p>
            <p>The one-way data binding is an approach where a value is taken from the data model and inserted into an HTML element. There is no way to update model from view. It is used in classical template systems. These systems bind data in only one direction.</p>
            <p>In AngularJS, expressions are used to bind application data to HTML. AngularJS resolves the expression, and return the result exactly where the expression is written.Expressions are written inside double braces {{expression}}.They can also be written inside a directive:</p>
            <p>AngularJS facilitates you to extend HTML with new attributes. These attributes are called directives.There is a set of built-in directive in AngularJS which offers functionality to your applications. You can also define your own directives.Directives are special attributes starting with ng- prefix. Following are the most common directives:</p>
            <p>ng-app directive defines the root element. It starts an AngularJS Application and automatically initializes or bootstraps the application when web page containing AngularJS Application is loaded. It is also used to load various AngularJS modules in AngularJS Application.</p>
