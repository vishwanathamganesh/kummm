            <p>Ruby tutorial provides basic and advanced concepts of Ruby. Our Ruby programming tutorial is designed for beginners and professionals both.Ruby is an open-source and fully object-oriented programming language.Our Ruby tutorial includes all topics of Ruby such as installation, example, operators, control statements, loops, comments, arrays, strings, hashes, regular expressions, file handling, exception handling, OOPs, Ranges, Iterators. etc</p>
            <p>Ruby is a dynamic, open source, object oriented and reflective programming language. Ruby is considered similar to Perl and Smalltalk programming languages. It runs on all types of platforms like Windows, Mac OS and all versions of UNIX.It is fully object oriented programming language. Everything is an object in Ruby. Each and every code has their properties and actions. Here properties refer to variables and actions refer to methods.Ruby is considered to follow the principle of POLA (principle of least astonishment). It means that the language behaves in such a way to minimize the confusion for experienced users.</p>
            <p>Perl is a scripting language but comes under the category of Toy language. Python is not fully object oriented language. Ruby developer Yukihiro "Martz" Matsumoto wanted a programming language which is completely object oriented and should be easy to use as a scripting language. He searched for this type of language, but couldn't find one. Hence, he developed one.</p>
            <p>The name "Ruby" originated during a chat session between Matsumoto and Keiju Ishitsuka. Two names were selected, "Coral" and "Ruby". Matsumoto chose the later one as it was the birthstone of one of his colleagues.</p>
            <p>The first public release of Ruby 0.95 was announced on Japanese newspaper on December 21, 1995. Within next two days, three more versions were released.Ruby was localized to Japan. To expand it, the Ruby-Talk, first English language Ruby mailing list was created.In 2001, first Ruby book "Programming Ruby" was published. After its publishment, learners of Ruby throughout the world increased.In 2005, they released their first Ruby framework "Ruby on Rails". The framework release was a big success and the Ruby community increased incredibly.</p>
            <p>The current Ruby version 2.4.0 was released on Christmas in 2016. It has several new features like improvement to hash table, instance variable access, Array#max and Array#min.</p>
            <p>Ruby is a great object oriented scripting programming language. Looking at its past we can say that it has a bright future if its community members continue expanding it beyond the thinki</p>
            <p>Ruby is purely object oriented programming language. Each and every value is an object. Every object has a class and every class has a super class. Every code has their properties and actions. Ruby is influenced with Smalltalk language. Rules applying to objects applies to the entire Ruby.</p>
            <p>Ruby is a flexible language as you can easily remove, redefine or add existing parts to it. It allows its users to freely alter its parts as they wish.</p>
            <p>Ruby has a feature of single inheritance only. Ruby has classes as well as modules. A module has methods but no instances. Instead, a module can be mixed into a class, which adds the method of that module to the class. It is similar to inheritance but much more flexible</p>
            <p>Ruby generally prefers English keyword and some punctuation is used to decorate Ruby. It doesn't need variable declaration.</p>
            <p>Ruby is a dynamic programming language. Ruby programs are not compiled. All class, module and method definition are built by the code when it run.Ruby variables are loosely typed language, which means any variable can hold any type of object. When a method is called on an object, Ruby only looks up at the name irrespective of the type of object. This is duck typing. It allows you to make classes that pretend to be other classes.</p>
            <p>In Ruby, constants are not really constant. If an already initialized constant will be modified in a script, it will simply trigger a warning but will not halt your program.</p>
            <p>Methods are allowed to end with question mark (?) or exclamation mark (!). By convention, methods that answer questions end with question mark and methods that indicates that method can change the state of the object end with exclamation mark.</p>
            <p>Ruby singleton methods are per-object methods. They are only available on the object you defined it on.</p>
            <p>Ruby variables are locations which hold data to be used in the programs. Each variable has a different name. These variable names are based on some naming conventions. Unlike other programming languages, there is no need to declare a variable in Ruby. A prefix is needed to indicate it.</p>
            <p>A local variable name starts with a lowercase letter or underscore (_). It is only accessible or have its scope within the block of its initialization. Once the code block completes, variable has no scope.When uninitialized local variables are called, they are interpreted as call to a method that has no arguments.</p>
            <p>A class variable name starts with @@ sign. They need to be initialized before use. A class variable belongs to the whole class and can be accessible from anywhere inside the class. If the value will be changed at one instance, it will be changed at every instance.A class variable is shared by all the descendents of the class. An uninitialized class variable will result in an error.</p>
            <p>An instance variable name starts with a @ sign. It belongs to one instance of the class and can be accessed from any instance of the class within a method. They only have limited access to a particular instance of a class.</p>
            <p>A global variable name starts with a $ sign. Its scope is globally, means it can be accessed from any where in a program.An uninitialized global variable will have a nil value. It is advised not to use them as they make programs cryptic and complex.</p>
