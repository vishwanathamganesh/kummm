            <p>AWS tutorial provides basic and advanced concepts. Our AWS tutorial is designed for beginners and professionals.AWS stands for Amazon Web Services which uses distributed IT infrastructure to provide different IT resources on demand.Our AWS tutorial includes all the topics such as introduction, history of aws, global infrastructure, features of aws, IAM, Storage services, Database services, etc.</p>
            <p>The AWS service is provided by the Amazon that uses distributed IT infrastructure to provide different IT resources available on demand. It provides different services such as infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS) and packaged software as a service (SaaS).</p>
            <p>Amazon launched AWS, a cloud computing platform to allow the different organizations to take advantage of reliable IT infrastructure.</p>
            <p>A small manufacturing organization uses their expertise to expand their business by leaving their IT management to the AWS.</p>
            <p>A large enterprise spread across the globe can utilize the AWS to deliver the training to the distributed workforce.An architecture consulting company can use AWS to get the high-compute rendering of construction prototype.</p>
            <p>A media company can use the AWS to provide different types of content such as ebox or audio files to the worldwide files.</p>
            <p>Advantages of AWS
              1) Flexibility
            We can get more time for core business tasks due to the instant availability of new features and services in AWS.It provides effortless hosting of legacy applications. AWS does not require learning new technologies and migration of applications to the AWS provides the advanced computing and efficient storage.AWS also offers a choice that whether we want to run the applications and services together or not. We can also choose to run a part of the IT infrastructure in AWS and the remaining part in data centres.</p>
            <p> Cost-effectiveness AWS requires no upfront investment, long-term commitment, and minimum expense when compared to traditional IT infrastructure that requires a huge investment.</p>
            <p>Through AWS, autoscaling and elastic load balancing techniques are automatically scaled up or down, when demand increases or decreases respectively. AWS techniques are ideal for handling unpredictable or very high loads. Due to this reason, organizations enjoy the benefits of reduced cost and increased user satisfaction.</p>
            <p>AWS provides end-to-end security and privacy to customers.AWS has a virtual infrastructure that offers optimum availability while managing full privacy and isolation of their operations.Customers can expect high-level of physical security because of Amazon's several years of experience in designing, developing and maintaining large-scale IT operation centers.AWS ensures the three aspects of security, i.e., Confidentiality, integrity, and availability of user's data.</p>
            <p>
              Centralised control of your AWS account: You can control creation, rotation, and cancellation of each user's security credentials. You can also control what data in the aws system users can access and how they can access.Shared Access to your AWS account: Users can share the resources for the collaborative projects.
              Granular permissions: It is used to set a permission that user can use a particular service but not other services.
              Identity Federation: An Identity Federation means that we can use Facebook, Active Directory, LinkedIn, etc with IAM. Users can log in to the AWS Console with same username and password as we log in with the Active Directory, Facebook, etc.
              Multifactor Authentication: An AWS provides multifactor authentication as we need to enter the username, password, and security check code to log in to the AWS Management Console.
              Permissions based on Organizational groups: Users can be restricted to the AWS access based on their job duties, for example, admin, developer, etc.
              Networking controls: IAM also ensures that the users can access the AWS resources within the organization's corporate network.
            </p>
            <p>Provide temporary access for users/devices and services where necessary: If you are using a mobile app and storing the data in AWS account, you can do this only when you are using temporary access.Integrates with many different aws services: IAM is integrated with many different aws services.
            Supports PCI DSS Compliance: PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) is a compliance framework. If you are taking credit card information, then you need to pay for compliance with the framework.
            Eventually Consistent: IAM service is eventually consistent as it achieves high availability by replicating the data across multiple servers within the Amazon's data center around the world.
            Free to use: AWS IAM is a feature of AWS account which is offered at no additional charge. You will be charged only when you access other AWS services by using IAM user.</p>
            <p>With SAML, both the service provider and identity provider exist separately, but centralizes the user management and provides access to the SaaS solutions.SAML authentication is mainly used for verifying the user's credentials from the identity provider.</p>
            <p>SAML SSO (SINGLE SIGN-ON): SAML provides security by eliminating passwords for an app and replacing them with the security tokens. Since we do not require any passwords for SAML logins, there is no risk of credentials to be stolen by unauthorized users. It provides faster, easier and trusted access to cloud applications.</p>
            <p>Open Standard SINGLE SIGN-ON: SAML implementations confirms to the open standard. Therefore, it is not restricted to a single identity provider. This open standard allows you to choose the SAML provider.</p>
            <p>Improved online experience for end users: SAML provides SINGLE SIGN-ON (SSO) to authenticate at an identity provider, and the identity provider sends the authentication to the service provider without additional credentials.</p>
            <p>An identity provider is an entity within a system that sends the authentication to the service provider is about who they are along with the user access rights.It maintains a directory of the user and provides an authentication mechanism.Microsoft Active Directory and Azure are the common identity providers.</p>
            <p>If a user tries to access the resource on the server, the service provider checks whether the user is authenticated within the system or not. If you are, you skip to step 7, and if you are not, the service provider starts the authentication process.The service provider determines the appropriate identity provider for you and redirects the request to the identity provider.An authentication request has been sent to the SSO (SINGLE SIGN-ON) service, and SSO service identifies you.</p>
