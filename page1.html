            <p>he C Language is developed by Dennis Ritchie for creating system applications that directly interact with the hardware devices such as drivers, kernels, etc.</p>
            <p>C language Tutorial with programming approach for beginners and professionals, helps you to understand the C language tutorial easily. Our C tutorial explains each topic with programs.</p>
            <p>C language is considered as the mother language of all the modern programming languages because most of the compilers, JVMs, Kernels, etc. are written in C language, and most of the programming languages follow C syntax, for example, C++, Java, C#, etc.</p>
            <p>It provides the core concepts like the array, strings, functions, file handling, etc. that are being used in many languages like C++, Java, C#, etc.</p>
            <p>A system programming language is used to create system software. C language is a system programming language because it can be used to do low-level programming (for example driver and kernel). It is generally used to create hardware devices, OS, drivers, kernels, etc. For example, Linux kernel is written in C.</p>
            <p>A procedure is known as a function, method, routine, subroutine, etc. A procedural language specifies a series of steps for the program to solve the problem.</p>
            <p>A structured programming language is a subset of the procedural language. Structure means to break a program into parts or blocks so that it may be easy to understand.</p>
            <p>In the C language, we break the program into parts using functions. It makes the program easier to understand and modify.</p>
            <p>C is considered as a middle-level language because it supports the feature of both low-level and high-level languages. C language program is converted into assembly code, it supports pointer arithmetic (low-level), but it is machine independent (a feature of high-level).</p>
            <p>A Low-level language is specific to one machine, i.e., machine dependent. It is machine dependent, fast to run. But it is not easy to understand.</p>
            <p>History of C language is interesting to know. Here we are going to discuss a brief history of the c language.</p>
            <p>C programming language was developed in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie at bell laboratories of AT&T (American Telephone & Telegraph), located in the U.S.A.</p>
            <p>Initially, C language was developed to be used in UNIX operating system. It inherits many features of previous languages such as B and BCPL.</p>
            <p>The basic data types are integer-based and floating-point based. C language supports both signed and unsigned literals.</p>
            <p>The memory size of the basic data types may change according to 32 or 64-bit operating system.</p>
            <p>Integers are entire numbers without any fractional or decimal parts, and the int data type is used to represent them.it is frequently applied to variables that include values, such as counts, indices, or other numerical numbers. The int data type may represent both positive and negative numbers because it is signed by default.An int takes up 4 bytes of memory on most devices, allowing it to store values between around -2 billion and +2 billion.</p>
            <p>Individual characters are represented by the char data type. Typically used to hold ASCII or UTF-8 encoding scheme characters, such as letters, numbers, symbols, or commas. There are 256 characters that can be represented by a single char, which takes up one byte of memory. Characters such as 'A', 'b', '5', or '$' are enclosed in single quotes</p>
