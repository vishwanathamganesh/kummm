            <p>Python is a widely used programming language that offers several unique features and advantages compared to languages like Java and C++. Our Python tutorial thoroughly explains Python basics and advanced concepts, starting with installation, conditional statements, loops, built-in data structures, Object-Oriented Programming, Generators, Exception Handling, Python RegEx, and many other concepts. This tutorial is designed for beginners and working professionals.In the late 1980s, Guido van Rossum dreamed of developing Python. The first version of Python 0.9.0 was released in 1991. Since its release, Python started gaining popularity. According to reports, Python is now the most popular programming language among developers because of its high demands in the tech realm</p>
            <p>Python is a general-purpose, dynamically typed, high-level, compiled and interpreted, garbage-collected, and purely object-oriented programming language that supports procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.</p>
            <p>Easy to use and Read - Python's syntax is clear and easy to read, making it an ideal language for both beginners and experienced programmers. This simplicity can lead to faster development and reduce the chances of errors.</p>
            <p>Dynamically Typed - The data types of variables are determined during run-time. We do not need to specify the data type of a variable during writing codes.</p>
            <p>High-level - High-level language means human readable code.</p>
            <p>Compiled and Interpreted - Python code first gets compiled into bytecode, and then interpreted line by line. When we download the Python in our system form org we download the default implement of Python known as CPython. CPython is considered to be Complied and Interpreted both.</p>
            <p>Garbage Collected - Memory allocation and de-allocation are automatically managed. Programmers do not specifically need to manage the memory.</p>
            <p>Purely Object-Oriented - It refers to everything as an object, including numbers and strings.</p>
            <p>Cross-platform Compatibility - Python can be easily installed on Windows, macOS, and various Linux distributions, allowing developers to create software that runs across different operating systems.</p>
            <p>Rich Standard Library - Python comes with several standard libraries that provide ready-to-use modules and functions for various tasks, ranging from web development and data manipulation to machine learning and networking.</p>
            <p>Open Source - Python is an open-source, cost-free programming language. It is utilized in several sectors and disciplines as a result.</p>
            <p>Python has many web-based assets, open-source projects, and a vibrant community. Learning the language, working together on projects, and contributing to the Python ecosystem are all made very easy for developers.</p>
            <p>Python is a case-sensitive language, which means that uppercase and lowercase letters are treated differently. For example, 'name' and 'Name' are two different variables in Python</p>
            <p>In Python, comments can be added using the '#' symbol. Any text written after the '#' symbol is considered a comment and is ignored by the interpreter. This trick is useful for adding notes to the code or temporarily disabling a code block. It also helps in understanding the code better by some other developers.</p>
            <p>'If', 'otherwise', 'for', 'while', 'try', 'except', and 'finally' are a few reserved keywords in Python that cannot be used as variable names. These terms are used in the language for particular reasons and have fixed meanings. If you use these keywords, your code may include errors, or the interpreter may reject them as potential new Variables.</p>
            <p>Python was created by Guido van Rossum. In the late 1980s, Guido van Rossum, a Dutch programmer, began working on Python while at the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands. He wanted to create a successor to the ABC programming language that would be easy to read and efficient.</p>
            <p>In February 1991, the first public version of Python, version 0.9.0, was released. This marked the official birth of Python as an open-source project. The language was named after the British comedy series "Monty Python's Flying Circus".</p>
